as soon as new users log in I need the app to ask multiple questions to the user around their experince to give them an initial ratingas soon as new users log in I need the app to ask multiple questions to the user around their experince to give them an initial rating so give me a list of questions I could ask...eg. have you played racquets sports before? how lpong etc. and then the app would have to automatically rank the player between our 1-7 scale

Absolutely — this is one of the most important features for Match Point.

Because in pickleball (and later padel/badminton), most new users have no rating history, so you need a strong onboarding questionnaire to estimate an initial DUR Rating (1–7).

Below is a professional, practical system:

✅ Questions players understand
✅ Easy to answer in under 2 minutes
✅ Automatically maps into DUR scale
✅ Works across racquet sports long-term

✅ Match Point Initial DUR Rating Questionnaire
